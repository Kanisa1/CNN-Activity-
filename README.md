# 🧠 CNN Image Classifier with Real-World Images

This project demonstrates a simple yet powerful **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built using **TensorFlow** to classify images. You will learn how to preprocess real images, build a custom CNN architecture, train and evaluate the model, and visualize predictions — all within a single Jupyter Notebook.

> 📸 You’ll start with 3 real images, resize them to 28×28 pixels, and feed them into a deep learning model for classification.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Load and preprocess real image data (grayscale + resized to 28×28)
- ✅ Build a simple CNN from scratch using TensorFlow/Keras
- ✅ Train and evaluate the model on your own image dataset
- ✅ Make predictions and visualize results
- ✅ Educational and beginner-friendly structure

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Requirements

Make sure you have Python and the required libraries:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib pillow
```

### 2. Run the Notebook

* Open `CNN_inclass_activity.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab.
* Upload **at least 3 images** (JPG/PNG).
* Update the `image_paths` list with your image filenames.
* Run all cells to preprocess, train, evaluate, and visualize.

---

## 📊 Results

The notebook will show:

* Model architecture summary
* Training accuracy and loss
* Evaluation performance
* Predicted vs. true labels (visualized)

Example output:

```
Loss: 0.0341, Accuracy: 1.0000
Predicted classes: [0, 1, 2]
True classes: [0, 1, 2]
```
